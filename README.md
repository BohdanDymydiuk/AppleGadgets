A modern web application built to showcase my front-end development skills, featuring a component-based architecture with React and TypeScript, styled with SCSS and CSS Modules. This project demonstrates my ability to create scalable, type-safe, and responsive interfaces, leveraging Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Key Features

  - **Component-Based UI**: Reusable React components for a modular and maintainable codebase.
  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration for robust code quality and error prevention.
  - **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts styled with SCSS and `module.scss` for scoped, modular CSS.
  - **Fast Build Tool**: Powered by Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.

## Technologies Used

  - **HTML5**: Semantic markup within JSX for structuring the applicationâ€™s interface.
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
  - **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to enhance code reliability and developer experience.
  - **SCSS**: Preprocessed CSS for advanced styling, paired with `module.scss` for scoped styles.
  - **Vite**: Next-generation build tool for rapid development and efficient bundling.
  - **Git**: Version control for project management and portfolio presentation.
